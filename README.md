# Matrix-Solver
A java program to manipulate matrices.

### Aim
The primary aim of this project is learn a little Java. The challenge at hand is to replicate matrix operations using basic java code - using TDD of course! User can interact with the program via the console

Operations includes:

```
Adding and subtracting two matrices of equal dimension
Calculating the determinant of a matrix of any dimension
Finding the inverse of a Matrix
Scalar multiplication
The transpose of a matrix (plus the classical adjoint)

Extension ... 
Solving linear equations using Cramer's rule. (If time permits)
```
